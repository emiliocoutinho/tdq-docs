## Markdown + notebooks

As it is markdown, you can embed images, HTML, etc into your posts!

![](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/logo.png)

You an also $add_{math}$ and

$$
math^{blocks}
$$

or

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mbox{mean} la_{tex} \\ \\
math blocks
\end{aligned}
$$

But make sure you \$Escape \$your \$dollar signs \$you want to keep!

## MyST markdown

MyST markdown works in Jupyter Notebooks as well. For more information about MyST markdown, check
out [the MyST guide in Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/content/myst.html),
or see [the MyST markdown documentation](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Code blocks and outputs

Jupyter Book will also embed your code blocks and output in your book.
For example, here's some sample Matplotlib code:
