    "by the boundary conditions, initial conditions, and physics defined in the previous sections.\n",

    "Additionally, here is where we will define the neural network size and depth. Currently, most PINN approaches use dense fully connected\n",
    "neural networks for function approximation. Fully-connected Neural Networks have some level of theoretical backing\n",
    "that they will converge to a solution of the underlying function {cite}`pinkus1999approximation,chen1993approximations`, and this\n",

    "\n",
    "TensorDiffEq uses the [Keras API](https://keras.io/) for neural network construction. All you need to do is define a list of layer\n",
    "sizes for your neural network. So, for a network with an `[x,t]` input, 4 layers deep, with 128 nodes, one would define\n",
    "a layer size list of `[2,128,128,1]`.\n",
